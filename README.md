# SmokeSensor

Project "Smoke/fire sensor to detect fire in the forrest"

The goal is to detect fire/smoke on pictures with AI locally 
without sending everything to the net and calculating there.

We started with a predefined classification neural network which we
adjusted to our pictures and two classes: fire and non_fire.

Actually this works in our laptop. But it should be adjusted to run
on a typical IoT device like a Arduino Sense with Tensorflow light.

It is still far to big for that so the next step is to run it on a
larger device from Siemens.
